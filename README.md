## Professional Summary

Driven by curiosity and a passion for growth, my career has spanned from Event Business Development and Project Management to becoming a Work Coach. This diverse journey has sharpened my skills in decision-making, communication, and embracing challenges.

Recently, my curiosity led me to the Makers Bootcamp, where I delved into full-stack software development, exploring the MERN stack and Python PostgreSQL Flask.

This experience not only expanded my technical skills but also reinforced my ability to work collaboratively in tech environments.

Now, as I transition into software development, I'm excited to merge my broad professional experiences and skills with my new technical skills and analytic problem-solving skill, aiming to contribute meaningfully to the tech world.
